# Bomb_Defusal_Simulation
This is a bomb defusal simulation game I created on the Basys 3 FPGA board. 

The Basys 3 board will function as a “bomb” with a timer counting down from 45 on the seven-segment display and using all the switches on the board as switches to defuse the bomb. If the user flips the correct switches, then the timer will stop going down. Once the timer gets to 7 seconds or under, an LED will start flashing indicating that the bomb is about to “explode.” Once the timer actually hits 0, a different LED turns on indicating that the bomb has “exploded.”
